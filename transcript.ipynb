    "- 0:00 - to gateway and show the new content type rule um I realized that we forgot to go\n",
    "- 0:04 - over the actual pentest categories and what they did so I think we should\n",
    "- 0:10 - probably do a different session today's going to be pretty hefty there's a the\n",
    "- 0:15 - you'll see the system's just slow in these modules it's like a TPRM audit is\n",
    "- 0:19 - just fundamentally big and a compliance audit is just a lot so well one of the\n",
    "- 0:24 - things I noticed and this will be the last thing is that I I actually kicked\n",
    "- 0:27 - one of these off in the TPRM module for I think it was copilot i did it\n",
    "- 0:32 - yesterday and like you can literally see in Asana like it's just like gradually\n",
    "- 0:38 - building up the tasks um so that took a little bit of time but\n",
    "- 0:43 - then I was like getting like spammed with emails on new tasks being created\n",
    "- 0:48 - for a little while i don't know if that's by design or not it's uh it's not\n",
    "- 0:52 - by design so what we've done with customers so far the issue is is that\n",
    "- 0:57 - only they can control their notification settings\n",
    "- 1:00 - and so what we've done so far is they get an invitation and we tell them\n",
    "- 1:04 - immediately to to assign or to change their\n",
    "- 1:09 - notification settings to not get the spam um we don't have a solution for\n",
    "- 1:14 - that yet yeah i mean it's not a huge deal only happened like as it was sort\n",
    "- 1:19 - of building out the workflow but that was like you know took\n",
    "- 1:23 - like 10 10 or 15 minutes I want I want want to say yeah I mean uh in EU AI act\n",
    "- 1:29 - it ends up being much worse it's like oh really 30 emails instead of just five so\n",
    "- 1:35 - yeah we we've got to figure out something there we just haven't figured\n",
    "- 1:38 - it out yet okay so let me start the recording this\n",
    "- 1:44 - meeting is being recorded All right this is perfect because I had\n",
    "- 1:57 - to I had to populate these two modules in the IBM system anyway so kill two\n",
    "- 2:04 - birds with one stone here um let's see\n",
    "- 2:14 - i think we will probably start\n",
    "- 2:20 - with TPRM i just need to check if Raman has fixed something\n",
    "- 2:26 - here okay yeah good that's fixed um all right we'll start with compliance\n",
    "- 2:32 - then so these two features compliance and\n",
    "- 2:36 - TPRM are heavily checklist oriented features um I'm not sure if you guys\n",
    "- 2:43 - have much exposure to TPRM assessments or compliance\n",
    "- 2:47 - assessments but fundamentally the way that they're kind of structured is you\n",
    "- 2:51 - you start with a risk assessment like based on the highle details about the\n",
    "- 2:56 - use case or the AI system you sort of narrow down or filter the requirements\n",
    "- 3:02 - and you end up with this list of requirements that require you to prove\n",
    "- 3:07 - that you are satisfying something so it could be\n",
    "- 3:13 - proving that you have certain controls in place proving that you have a policy\n",
    "- 3:17 - that type of thing and so again it's like it's very checklist\n",
    "- 3:21 - oriented so the way that we manage that is through a sauna which I think Abdel\n",
    "- 3:29 - has invited all of you to for your own work management um and I can't remember\n",
    "- 3:34 - did you guys play around with compliance in your first couple of\n",
    "- 3:40 - days kevin I I did okay\n",
    "- 3:47 - all right so you've seen the Asana interface a little bit it's like it's a\n",
    "- 3:52 - checklist right it's kind of like a dashboard or a flow where you go through\n",
    "- 3:56 - each list and you you get a set of tasks and then you complete each task and so\n",
    "- 4:01 - that's why we chose to use a sauna because it it kind of mirrors the\n",
    "- 4:06 - process of TPRM or compliance quite well where you have a set of requirements\n",
    "- 4:11 - tasks to complete you comment you fill in evidence whatever it is you mark it\n",
    "- 4:16 - complete it gets reviewed and then when you've finished everything in your\n",
    "- 4:20 - project you're done now compliance is focusing on the\n",
    "- 4:27 - main AI frameworks right now we only support three ISO\n",
    "- 4:32 - 420,01 EU AI act and then we support one of the playbooks in NIST AI RMF\n",
    "- 4:41 - um the plan is to just slowly expand that but we currently only have one\n",
    "- 4:46 - lawyer on staff and these things are mind-numbing especially the EUA AI act\n",
    "- 4:52 - so it's uh it's slowgoing creating them now starting from the beginning this is\n",
    "- 5:00 - how a customer is expected to interact with the compliance module uh the first\n",
    "- 5:06 - thing that they would do is they would go to the compliance\n",
    "- 5:09 - compass and so the compliance compass is a mapping of which frameworks or audits\n",
    "- 5:18 - regulations your project needs to begin compliance with and so the way that it\n",
    "- 5:24 - works is the customer comes to compass here they select a project say Optima\n",
    "- 5:29 - Health and then they have to fill in a questionnaire\n",
    "- 5:34 - so the questionnaire is currently just 14 questions uh pretty\n",
    "- 5:39 - straightforward i'm going to answer this in a way where we get a couple of\n",
    "- 5:45 - frameworks out of it let's go with that and let's\n",
    "- 5:52 - say Canada Singapore now the plan is for all of\n",
    "- 6:05 - these things all of these questions to be pulled into the compliance audit\n",
    "- 6:09 - you'll you'll see when we get to the risk assessment what that looks like um\n",
    "- 6:13 - it's not hooked up yet but they're working on it like the idea is is you\n",
    "- 6:17 - should have to answer this kind of project metadata in one spot and then it\n",
    "- 6:21 - filters into everything else uh it's just a matter of tying together the two\n",
    "- 6:26 - modules right now I'll say no i'll say no and I'll say\n",
    "- 6:31 - no all right so you submit your responses\n",
    "- 6:36 - the system evaluates what you said and then it suggests it it indicates which\n",
    "- 6:42 - frameworks are fundamentally required like based on the information you've\n",
    "- 6:45 - given us you operate in the EU you use a generate or you use an AI system you\n",
    "- 6:51 - definitely are required to at least go through the EU AI act audit and then\n",
    "- 6:57 - these are suggested frameworks um [ __ ] could you just take a quick screenshot\n",
    "- 7:02 - of this there's just like a weird styling going on here that we should\n",
    "- 7:05 - pass to Clea yeah one second right i thought you said there was only three\n",
    "- 7:10 - that we were So we only support detailed audits for the three okay but we've\n",
    "- 7:16 - we've done the mapping for many more so we we've created like a mapping where\n",
    "- 7:22 - where we can tell you that you're required or that you should do the\n",
    "- 7:25 - Singaporean model AI governance framework because if you caught in the\n",
    "- 7:29 - questions that I just answered I said that the the system's used in Singapore\n",
    "- 7:33 - and so it gets suggested um similarly so what does that what does\n",
    "- 7:38 - that mean like if if it's enabled but we don't fully support it like what does\n",
    "- 7:42 - that actually end up looking like it's just a matter of tracking in our system\n",
    "- 7:46 - um I'll I'll show you in a second so I'm going to So you can actually go through\n",
    "- 7:50 - and you can pick like the frequency that you want to repeat these audits um and\n",
    "- 7:54 - then you can turn off audits that you don't want to do so I'm going to turn\n",
    "- 7:57 - off a couple of them uh I'll turn off that one and I'll turn off that one i'll\n",
    "- 8:02 - keep these guys on um and I'll set this to semiannually\n",
    "- 8:08 - great all right so you save changes and so this turns on policies in the back\n",
    "- 8:12 - end and so the the policies are effectively checking have you either\n",
    "- 8:19 - completed an audit within our system or manually indicated that you've achieved\n",
    "- 8:25 - compliance with that framework um let me just show you how\n",
    "- 8:30 - that's done so you can see here these are the the frameworks that I indicated\n",
    "- 8:34 - I wanted to turn on these are the ones that I ignored but they're listed as\n",
    "- 8:39 - available down below you can see the the tags that were assigned to this project\n",
    "- 8:44 - based on my answers so this kind of gives some insight into why these\n",
    "- 8:49 - frameworks were suggested and\n",
    "- 8:54 - now if I go to the dashboard you'll see here now\n",
    "- 9:02 - that three audit gaps have been identified and so these map to the three\n",
    "- 9:08 - frameworks that we turned on as required policies and what it means is that as\n",
    "- 9:14 - far as our system is is able to tell or as far as our system knows you have not\n",
    "- 9:19 - achieved compliance with EU AI act ISO 42,0001 and the accountability report if\n",
    "- 9:26 - you go down to the heat map you'll see the same thing right euai act 0% ISO 0\n",
    "- 9:31 - accountability report zero everything else is gray because you haven't\n",
    "- 9:34 - indicated that that's required so now you asked what does it mean like\n",
    "- 9:41 - if if we don't support it what do you actually do uh you can click here oh we\n",
    "- 9:46 - turned that off never mind so you can click here and you can mark it completed\n",
    "- 9:50 - in which case you manually indicate that you completed it and so what'll happen\n",
    "- 9:56 - is is the gap will go away it'll now be marked as 100% on your\n",
    "- 10:02 - heat map and in a year or whatever the frequency was the gap will\n",
    "- 10:10 - be recreated by the system to tell you hey you're you're you're due again for\n",
    "- 10:17 - completing the accountability report audit okay so so these are like uh\n",
    "- 10:21 - things that are being done externally by the customer exactly and they're just\n",
    "- 10:26 - have an option to indicate here that they did it separately versus something\n",
    "- 10:30 - that we support and they're doing through a sauna exactly um and so if I\n",
    "- 10:35 - go to like the AI3 dashboard now you're going to see accountability report 100%\n",
    "- 10:39 - here so it just it gives it's uh our way of of making it so that they don't need\n",
    "- 10:45 - to track it in a different system they can have it all within our\n",
    "- 10:50 - platform even though we don't support the full audit yet yeah and it's a case\n",
    "- 10:55 - of either 0% or 100% on those exactly there's no way to say I'm 50% done yep\n",
    "- 11:01 - yeah all right so these other two gaps are both things that are supported by\n",
    "- 11:05 - our platform um we will we'll initiate both of them\n",
    "- 11:13 - right now so there's two ways to do it you can either click here on the gap and\n",
    "- 11:17 - say initiate audit uh you pick the project that it applies to you assign\n",
    "- 11:22 - the user that's going to be the owner of the audit and you pick a due\n",
    "- 11:29 - date all right so now that audit project is being generated in a sauna and when\n",
    "- 11:35 - it's when it's actually been picked up and the audit project exists then this\n",
    "- 11:39 - button will become clickable the other way that you can initiate an audit is on\n",
    "- 11:44 - the audit page you can go here you say EU AI act again Ryan due date uh let's\n",
    "- 11:54 - say you want to make it a further out due date i'll put July 7th you'll see\n",
    "- 11:59 - when we get to the audit that dates are applied to each\n",
    "- 12:04 - task and so the dates just adjust based on whatever you select\n",
    "- 12:11 - here all right so both of those are being generated in the background\n",
    "- 12:19 - now when you create that policy that you need to to be compliant with ISO 4201\n",
    "- 12:27 - encompass within the knowledge hub which is where we allow the customer to store\n",
    "- 12:33 - documentation or evidence that's proof that they've achieved compliance with\n",
    "- 12:38 - certain with their frameworks uh we create these\n",
    "- 12:42 - required policies so as soon as you turn on that compass requirement or that\n",
    "- 12:48 - compass policy now we say okay if you need to be compliant with ISO 4201 then\n",
    "- 12:53 - in this project Optima Health you're required to have an AI policy an AI\n",
    "- 12:59 - management system an AI risk assessment plan all of these various policies that\n",
    "- 13:04 - are necessary components of ISO 4201 compliance there's two ways to get a\n",
    "- 13:11 - policy into knowledge hub similar to compliance frameworks\n",
    "- 13:16 - we're slowly picking them up through policy\n",
    "- 13:20 - templates or you can manually upload one and so I'll show you both of those\n",
    "- 13:29 - um the way that it works is you go here add new\n",
    "- 13:33 - policy you select the policy name so for example data set data sheet is one that\n",
    "- 13:39 - we support either uploading or we have a a template that we've already created so\n",
    "- 13:45 - I'm going to start that project so that I can show you how that kicks off um you\n",
    "- 13:50 - click confirm and now same deal in the back end we're creating a project in a\n",
    "- 13:57 - sauna that allows the customer or the user to use a set like a predefined\n",
    "- 14:03 - template to generate this policy type a data set data\n",
    "- 14:08 - sheet the other thing that you can do is you can pick a policy type i'll go AI\n",
    "- 14:13 - management system and if it's not supported by the system you'll see this\n",
    "- 14:17 - is grayed out and you can just upload something that you've already prepared\n",
    "- 14:22 - so I'm going to upload\n",
    "- 14:27 - documents i'm going to upload an ISO AI management system sample um you you\n",
    "- 14:34 - select what you want to assign it to so I'm going to assign it to Optima Health\n",
    "- 14:43 - perfect and now that policy is in my the one that I just uploaded is in my\n",
    "- 14:49 - approved tab and if I want to go check I can download it\n",
    "- 14:56 - here and there's the policy this is what it looks like so\n",
    "- 15:02 - that's a sample that I've already uploaded to knowledge this is like the\n",
    "- 15:05 - organization's AI management policy that they created and that they\n",
    "- 15:12 - can upload to the system for the purpose of providing evidence that they have\n",
    "- 15:15 - this in place exactly can you share this with us just so we\n",
    "- 15:20 - Yeah absolutely yeah thanks yeah I'll send it to you um and so so once they\n",
    "- 15:26 - upload once they upload this then then Okay so you're going to go in and\n",
    "- 15:29 - probably like check one of these things off as like complete or so so that\n",
    "- 15:35 - required AI management system policy is gone now it's disappeared you see so\n",
    "- 15:40 - it's it used to be here and it's gone so that's that's been\n",
    "- 15:44 - picked up that the required document has now been approved it exists in knowledge\n",
    "- 15:49 - hub it's no longer an outstanding item and I kind of missed is that because of\n",
    "- 15:54 - something that you indicated when you added the new policy or was that done\n",
    "- 15:57 - automatically in the back done automatically based No it's just uh\n",
    "- 16:01 - based on the type i see like based on the fact that I select that I selected\n",
    "- 16:06 - AI management system here yep it got rid of that yeah okay\n",
    "- 16:10 - okay so now I'm going\n",
    "- 16:15 - to go through how you actually generate a\n",
    "- 16:18 - policy using our policy builder uh so this is one that I kicked off just\n",
    "- 16:24 - before this meeting so it's actually already done in a sauna\n",
    "- 16:40 - hopefully okay so you're you're going to notice this pattern of\n",
    "- 16:46 - background existing documentation details throughout everything throughout\n",
    "- 16:51 - TPRM compliance audits and policy builder it's kind of just our framework\n",
    "- 16:56 - of collect a bunch of like ask a bunch of yes or no questions to filter what to\n",
    "- 17:02 - include and then ask for them to upload documents and ask the the detailed\n",
    "- 17:08 - questions like what would get into the bulk of whatever we're trying to\n",
    "- 17:12 - collect um so the all of every ASA thing that we look at today every project\n",
    "- 17:20 - whether it be for policy builder TPRM or compliance is going to follow this same\n",
    "- 17:24 - structure and so it always starts with the first section where you have a\n",
    "- 17:29 - series of yes or no questions um so if you click on the c\n",
    "- 17:34 - the task it maps to a category so this category is policy requirements\n",
    "- 17:38 - determines the requirements to be addressed by your policy um is your\n",
    "- 17:42 - organization required to comply with any mandatory a artificial intelligence\n",
    "- 17:46 - regulations we'll say no uh we'll say yes and so what the user\n",
    "- 17:52 - does is they make a selection they click complete they kick complete\n",
    "- 18:01 - there and so the way that our systems working is it's all web hook based uh as\n",
    "- 18:07 - soon as you click complete a web hook calls out to our back end says \"Hey the\n",
    "- 18:12 - users's answered this question.\" Um we post a response received comment for\n",
    "- 18:18 - feedback and then you see that category was automatically marked complete the\n",
    "- 18:23 - system basically said \"Hey whoever was doing this finished both questions\n",
    "- 18:26 - they're done.\" It assigned it to all true now this is a little confusing\n",
    "- 18:30 - because my name is also all true but if you can imagine this would be the\n",
    "- 18:34 - customer's name um the red is me the pink is our AI\n",
    "- 18:41 - system that's a bug uh [ __ ] could you take a picture of that as well\n",
    "- 18:47 - and for Alex Yang it should be AI at Altra.ai not Seagal Inc\n",
    "- 18:54 - oh it's Orie's other company yeah exactly\n",
    "- 19:00 - all right let me just whiz through this\n",
    "- 19:06 - quickly um yes no yes hey Ryan I missed how you\n",
    "- 19:16 - actually got into the Asana interface from the platform for this yeah sure so\n",
    "- 19:22 - I went to draft here which is like my my draft policy templates the things that\n",
    "- 19:27 - I'm the policies that I'm currently building and then right here there's\n",
    "- 19:31 - this link button is there an issue if I click on that and follow that myself\n",
    "- 19:35 - just to see I'm on the I'm on the system i don't know if it'll cause problems if\n",
    "- 19:39 - I click on it so try it right now it's probably not going to give you access to\n",
    "- 19:44 - the project um that's something that is actually being a hot fix hopefully\n",
    "- 19:49 - tomorrow oh I have to request it but I'll leave it alone yeah that's fine\n",
    "- 19:53 - yeah so what we're what we're changing is that anybody who has access to this\n",
    "- 19:57 - page and can see the project if they click the link the first thing we'll do\n",
    "- 20:01 - is add them to the project and then we'll open the ASA\n",
    "- 20:06 - project makes sense yeah um because currently right now I\n",
    "- 20:11 - would have to invite you which I'll I'll do\n",
    "- 20:14 - but that's the way that the customer has to handle it right now um Okay so let me\n",
    "- 20:20 - just keep going i'll say internal use yes external use no can I ask a\n",
    "- 20:26 - question please yeah sure so I see due date of May 16 but where\n",
    "- 20:34 - did we put May 16 um so when I created the project here\n",
    "- 20:45 - just again it asked me to submit a due date and so\n",
    "- 20:50 - I put May 16th in it gotcha okay all right so has your organization\n",
    "- 20:58 - already allocated no uh ISO compliance i'll say yes it\n",
    "- 21:02 - needs to be ISO compliant and so I I mean I'll be honest it's just\n",
    "- 21:10 - a clunky UI right now it saved us months of\n",
    "- 21:14 - work by kind of leveraging what ASA\n",
    "- 21:21 - offers um but it's it's just not it's not smooth it's not like crisp\n",
    "- 21:31 - and I don't know i' I'd love to hear what you guys think where we're\n",
    "- 21:35 - currently trying to come up with a plan to move it into our\n",
    "- 21:38 - system um we've we've got the capacity now to do it but I'd love to get your\n",
    "- 21:45 - thoughts on on how well it runs okay have to play with it for a while i\n",
    "- 21:52 - mean I I personally don't think Assan is that bad i just think like issues with\n",
    "- 21:56 - access like if I click on a button that you said you know like I would have to\n",
    "- 22:00 - get you to approve it separately just like things like that but I mean you're\n",
    "- 22:06 - already fixing that so yeah it's sounds like it's getting a little better it's\n",
    "- 22:10 - getting a little better but like I'm I'm always worried that we're going to run\n",
    "- 22:13 - into something where we're like oh no this is\n",
    "- 22:17 - the end of the world we got to rip out a Sonic completely\n",
    "- 22:22 - we haven't run into it yet but we'll see all right so when I when I finished that\n",
    "- 22:28 - last subtask and marked it complete it picked up the last category now it says\n",
    "- 22:33 - background section completed now it says processing responses uh what's actually\n",
    "- 22:38 - happening right now is there's a transaction processor that runs every\n",
    "- 22:41 - two minutes and so the web hook was received\n",
    "- 22:46 - it queued up a task in Reddis Q and then as soon as that transaction processor\n",
    "- 22:50 - runs it'll start generating the next two sections so we'll see if that\n",
    "- 23:03 - happens and in the meantime I need to grab\n",
    "- 23:09 - something from over here yeah\n",
    "- 23:39 - perfect all right wonderful that's what I needed\n",
    "- 23:44 - see how this is doing still hasn't\n",
    "- 23:57 - happened all right it's working here it's not stuck it's just\n",
    "- 24:06 - uh transaction processor just picked it up so now it should be generating each\n",
    "- 24:12 - of the tasks if we go back here we should see something\n",
    "- 24:24 - happening it's generated do you have like PDFs for some of these\n",
    "- 24:46 - other like requirements like I don't know like is I'm looking at\n",
    "- 24:51 - AI risk assessment plan documented plan outlining how your organization\n",
    "- 24:55 - identifies evaluates blah blah blah or is a lot of this stuff populated\n",
    "- 25:01 - through the questionnaires in Asana sorry can you say that one\n",
    "- 25:06 - again so like if you go to the knowledge hub yep under\n",
    "- 25:13 - required so like the AI policy is something that we're sort of like\n",
    "- 25:18 - populating in Asana currently right but then um\n",
    "- 25:25 - like if so is it like an eitheror like if I have a document that already\n",
    "- 25:30 - outlines these things I can just upload it or exactly okay either or\n",
    "- 25:36 - Yeah okay so I upload it the system understands what it is based on the\n",
    "- 25:41 - content and it automatically removes it from here but if I want to start it as a\n",
    "- 25:47 - workflow then I have to in a sauna because I don't have a document then I\n",
    "- 25:51 - go to add new policy and go through this whole process i'm just trying to\n",
    "- 25:54 - understand like the general flow exactly you got it okay\n",
    "- 25:58 - and so I think what's happening right now is one of the other audits that I\n",
    "- 26:02 - kicked off is consuming the system it's uh it's running through and generating\n",
    "- 26:08 - them like if I go back here I go to dashboard that we'll see one of these\n",
    "- 26:14 - two generating right now it's kind of interesting like like\n",
    "- 26:23 - issues like this where there's a lot of stuff running in the background for a\n",
    "- 26:26 - given tenant does that affect other tenants on the on the system or is it\n",
    "- 26:32 - just this uh particular tenant that would be affected it should be just this\n",
    "- 26:37 - particular tenant like there should be multi-threading that would do a\n",
    "- 26:41 - different tenant um I got to double check with Arsha that\n",
    "- 26:46 - it's being applied here though like in in my opinion that should be applying to\n",
    "- 26:50 - the projects as well there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to generate\n",
    "- 26:53 - multiple at once so like I mentioned earlier EUAI act is\n",
    "- 27:01 - huge so that's exactly what's happening you can see that this thing's still\n",
    "- 27:06 - generating um like the risk assessment section of EUI act is 150 questions\n",
    "- 27:21 - yeah I can see some of those things have like 20 subtasks yeah which again it's\n",
    "- 27:27 - like this we're we're 100% pulling into our front end uh it's going to be the\n",
    "- 27:32 - same design as what we have for Compass where it's like this this\n",
    "- 27:38 - questionnaire approach um because there's there's no reason why\n",
    "- 27:44 - we need 20 different questions to answer what roles you have right like this\n",
    "- 27:49 - should be one question to say am I a provider deployer importer distributor\n",
    "- 27:54 - right yeah um and then we're also doing dynamic question generation logic like\n",
    "- 28:01 - if there's some of these here like uh biometrics where we can ask one question\n",
    "- 28:07 - is biometrics involved in your system and if the answer is no then all seven\n",
    "- 28:11 - of these questions go away asana doesn't let us do that uh so so\n",
    "- 28:16 - that's why we're going to pull it into front end gotcha\n",
    "- 28:22 - all right let's see is this thing almost done\n",
    "- 28:26 - i think there are 23 categories so we're we're getting\n",
    "- 28:29 - there um what can I do in the meantime i'll\n",
    "- 28:34 - start answering these yes\n",
    "- 28:53 - we'll go through these after i'm just filling it in ahead of\n",
    "- 29:10 - time let me just think if there's anything else in compliance that's worth\n",
    "- 29:14 - showing right now uh while we wait for this I'll show you\n",
    "- 29:21 - guys what a completed audit project report looks like\n",
    "- 29:59 - so I'll I'll explain later once the audit report or once the audit project\n",
    "- 30:04 - is generated how we get to this stage but this is what a a completed audit\n",
    "- 30:09 - report looks like it's kind of similar to our pentest reports where you have a\n",
    "- 30:13 - cover page cover letter uh and\n",
    "- 30:18 - then all the good stuff audit outcome what categories were assessed the risk\n",
    "- 30:24 - assessment findings what risk levels were assigned\n",
    "- 30:31 - uh and then we go through each category in detail what were our\n",
    "- 30:35 - findings what can be improved on uh and then a record of exactly what\n",
    "- 30:43 - responses were given for the workflow in Asana um for\n",
    "- 30:55 - some of these frameworks I believe that a lot of the questions the system\n",
    "- 31:00 - automatically infers from like the data that exists already from things like AI\n",
    "- 31:06 - discovery and SPM and like guardrails that are applied\n",
    "- 31:11 - do I have that right yeah it's\n",
    "- 31:16 - uh it's not as much as we want at the moment uh there are only a couple of\n",
    "- 31:20 - things right now that are automatically mapped and part of that's just\n",
    "- 31:26 - um not getting to it we just haven't uh implemented those mappings fully and the\n",
    "- 31:32 - other part is that many of these requirements are kind of built around\n",
    "- 31:36 - governance right uh which is less security oriented like pentesting\n",
    "- 31:41 - usually covers one requirement in the entire audit um then the modules that\n",
    "- 31:46 - we're building now around AI governance and trust start to take off a lot of\n",
    "- 31:53 - requirements so like one of the modules that we're building now is all about\n",
    "- 31:57 - performance and robust and\n",
    "- 32:00 - bias and those are huge sections of all of these audits so those will be mapped\n",
    "- 32:05 - and then we'll start to see a bunch of things being crossed\n",
    "- 32:09 - off but yeah it was it was actually based on what we currently have it's\n",
    "- 32:14 - it's quite tough to draw the mappings directly to requirements\n",
    "- 32:22 - just a quick question i know that IBM has Watson X that's uh that also does uh\n",
    "- 32:29 - that also addresses bias so so are we going to also have\n",
    "- 32:34 - bias um on the all true platforms yep absolutely we're going to do data set\n",
    "- 32:40 - bias and then we're going to do bias of the actual\n",
    "- 32:44 - model um awesome yes all right let me just see where we are\n",
    "- 32:52 - here okay so this is done generating so now this guy should be going\n",
    "- 33:02 - hopefully oh you know what because I kicked off so there's definitely not\n",
    "- 33:07 - multi-threading happening within a tenant right now uh but remember I\n",
    "- 33:11 - kicked off the data set data sheet so that's generating now\n",
    "- 33:28 - looks like it's done all right so that's all done so we should be on to this\n",
    "- 33:33 - now what's going on here let's\n",
    "- 33:56 - see yeah there we go by the way if if you\n",
    "- 34:19 - guys can see like after you've had a chance to play around with this if\n",
    "- 34:23 - anyone can or feels inspired to come up with a a really slick demo for\n",
    "- 34:30 - compliance or TPRM it would be much appreciated\n",
    "- 34:34 - because we we really have not been able to demo it successfully fully so far\n",
    "- 34:39 - just because of how much time it takes to generate these\n",
    "- 34:43 - things um it's just it's been difficult it's been\n",
    "- 34:50 - challenging for the for demos so what we currently do is we have things set up at\n",
    "- 34:54 - predefined points um so for example like we would have an audit that's kicked off\n",
    "- 35:00 - the risk assessment and another one that's already in the middle of the\n",
    "- 35:03 - requirement section and then we show that during the the demos or the\n",
    "- 35:09 - PC's but if anybody has ideas in terms of how we can do something slick let us\n",
    "- 35:15 - know um okay so our AI policy we finished the background section based on\n",
    "- 35:22 - the responses a series of questions have\n",
    "- 35:26 - been generated so for example in the policy\n",
    "- 35:30 - context category briefly explain how your organization allows employees to\n",
    "- 35:35 - use thirdparty AI services there are probably 20 questions here in\n",
    "- 35:41 - total um and so I'll start by showing you how you answer them so what the what\n",
    "- 35:48 - the user does is they go they pick a subtask so briefly explain how your\n",
    "- 35:52 - organization allows employees to use thirdparty AI\n",
    "- 35:55 - services um so they the user comes to the comments section and types in their\n",
    "- 36:01 - response uh so our organization uh lets employees do whatever they want\n",
    "- 36:09 - with third party AI there are no restrictions uh\n",
    "- 36:17 - whatsoever as long as it uh improves output slash\n",
    "- 36:26 - productivity we are all for it all right so they they comment it\n",
    "- 36:33 - they click submit and now that response is\n",
    "- 36:40 - saved in the back end and so they can either go through you'll see response\n",
    "- 36:45 - recorded they can either go through and fill in responses for everything there\n",
    "- 36:51 - or if they have an existing document for example if they have an existing AI\n",
    "- 36:57 - policy what they can do is they can come here and they can upload\n",
    "- 37:03 - it now this is the first time that I'm testing this on the demo environment\n",
    "- 37:11 - so there is a chance that it won't work let's\n",
    "- 37:17 - see so they upload that there give it two seconds to see if it\n",
    "- 37:26 - gets all right so it was just received and uploaded to the knowledgeb hub now\n",
    "- 37:31 - what the system is doing in the back end it's taking that\n",
    "- 37:36 - document it's breaking it up into chunks taking each chunk turning it into\n",
    "- 37:43 - a vector embedding storing that in a vector\n",
    "- 37:46 - store and then it's looping through every\n",
    "- 37:52 - question each of these being the questions it's taking the question and\n",
    "- 37:56 - saying is there anything from the evidence that was just uploaded that is\n",
    "- 38:01 - relevant to answer this question and so the the the brute force way to do it is\n",
    "- 38:06 - take the whole document and just run it through chat GBT with the\n",
    "- 38:11 - question and get an answer if we were to do that 20 questions times a 15-page\n",
    "- 38:16 - document starts to become a lot of chat GPT calls so we do the vector store\n",
    "- 38:21 - approach and the way that the vector store works is it finds something that's\n",
    "- 38:25 - very semantically similar to this question so it'll it'll pull out five or\n",
    "- 38:30 - 10 chunks that are very close to this question in terms of semantic meaning\n",
    "- 38:35 - it'll feed those five to 10 chunks into the an LLM and say \"Do these five to 10\n",
    "- 38:41 - chunks answer this question?\" If it does it'll generate a pre-populated answer\n",
    "- 38:49 - and so if that's working you will start to see those getting filled in for the\n",
    "- 38:54 - customer as comments uh let's see how we're doing\n",
    "- 38:59 - with that no\n",
    "- 39:08 - errors see now this looks like somebody working in\n",
    "- 39:25 - front end so and so then like in the audit report\n",
    "- 39:30 - does the system provide whatever snippets it was successfully able to\n",
    "- 39:34 - find to address these things as like evidence exactly i mean we're not even\n",
    "- 39:39 - in the audit report right now um when we get\n",
    "- 39:43 - there you'll see it right now what it's doing is just extracting Does it add it\n",
    "- 39:48 - as comments to the questions yeah it adds it as comments that's cool\n",
    "- 39:58 - uh just wish it worked quicker i don't actually see it working\n",
    "- 40:09 - here which is why I'm a little worried they make sure with Raman that\n",
    "- 40:21 - it's up and\n",
    "- 40:46 - running all right I'm just going to give the system\n",
    "- 40:58 - a little nudge here okay so it just started a minute ago so\n",
    "- 41:52 - hopefully it's being picked up now oh what's that there we got\n",
    "- 41:58 - something nope that's observability ability all right so we it got called\n",
    "- 42:29 - here and it's still ongoing so we'll just give this another\n",
    "- 42:41 - minute if it doesn't work I'll just fill it in manually um\n",
    "- 43:16 - Anyway so there the the idea is is that we want to\n",
    "- 43:21 - give the customer the ability to generate these\n",
    "- 43:25 - templates um the the way that we think is correct\n",
    "- 43:31 - so we we give them the policy template project if they don't have anything they\n",
    "- 43:35 - can generate it from scratch by answering the questions manually filling\n",
    "- 43:39 - each one in when they're done it'll generate the policy for them if they do\n",
    "- 43:43 - already have something that maybe they just threw together themselves to have\n",
    "- 43:48 - an AI policy they can take that they can upload it and it gives them a starting\n",
    "- 43:52 - point it fills in say half of the questions or a quarter of the questions\n",
    "- 43:57 - and then they they don't have to redo those answers they just have to do\n",
    "- 44:00 - whatever's left over that's the reason for this\n",
    "- 44:04 - functionality um now you can imagine if you were a customer and you uploaded it\n",
    "- 44:09 - and you're just sitting here waiting you'd obviously you you would\n",
    "- 44:14 - probably get lost you'd say \"What's going on?\" Like \"What's supposed to\n",
    "- 44:18 - happen?\" So for the AI management system that we\n",
    "- 44:26 - uploaded earlier and that took care of that line item for AI management system\n",
    "- 44:32 - where did you where did you upload that again where did you go to upload that\n",
    "- 44:36 - you uploaded it directly add new policy yeah I uploaded it directly from here i\n",
    "- 44:41 - went to AI management system upload a document yeah and so why wouldn't you\n",
    "- 44:45 - have just if you have an AI policy document like wouldn't you be able to\n",
    "- 44:49 - theoretically do that for the uh AI policy line item as well\n",
    "- 44:56 - you can as well and it will also get pulled in to this thing here if you then\n",
    "- 45:01 - were to go create an audit but the the idea is is if you don't have like a an\n",
    "- 45:07 - AI policy that you think is watertight right right or you'll see when we\n",
    "- 45:13 - actually initiate the audit the AI policy in your knowledge hub gets pulled\n",
    "- 45:18 - in and if it doesn't satisfy all the requirements then maybe you have to go\n",
    "- 45:21 - and update your AI policy to meet all of the requirements\n",
    "- 45:26 - in which case you might do our our template project\n",
    "- 45:33 - i don't know what's going on here let me ask Ramon and\n",
    "- 45:39 - so what what happens if like I if I uploaded that AI policy\n",
    "- 45:44 - directly and let's say it didn't have everything I needed in there to satisfy\n",
    "- 45:49 - would it still go into approved or does that go on like into under review or\n",
    "- 45:53 - something so approved is is whether or not your organization has approved the\n",
    "- 46:00 - document so you'll see when we complete this project here and our AI policy is\n",
    "- 46:06 - spit out it will go into the under review tab and then your organization\n",
    "- 46:11 - gets to take that review it if you're happy with it you mark it\n",
    "- 46:15 - approved only documents that are approved are used for compliance\n",
    "- 46:20 - evidence okay right so basically it means that\n",
    "- 46:25 - you can what what we're saying is that\n",
    "- 46:28 - anything that you're uploading directly is automatically assumed to be\n",
    "- 46:33 - approved it's assumed that you've gone through you've so they have to make a\n",
    "- 46:38 - judgment call up front to say we know this is good this has been approved we\n",
    "- 46:42 - don't need to go through anything versus not so sure that this is complete so\n",
    "- 46:47 - we'll use it to supplement but we still want to go through the process\n",
    "- 46:52 - exactly got it um all right so we're going to come back\n",
    "- 47:02 - to this raman is checking what's going on\n",
    "- 47:08 - and All right i'm not going to do So this was the other one that I created\n",
    "- 47:12 - that's not important all right so now we've got our ISO audit here\n",
    "- 47:19 - um so this again we generated from the dashboard we had the the audit gap so we\n",
    "- 47:25 - we kicked it off here once it's kicked off it's now in active audits click here\n",
    "- 47:31 - to open it all right so while we were waiting\n",
    "- 47:44 - before I answered a couple of these questions again these are it the risk\n",
    "- 47:48 - assessment starts with a series of yes or no questions things like does your\n",
    "- 47:51 - organization work with one or more systems that are AI systems if you were\n",
    "- 47:55 - to answer no to this then the audit's dead right there because ISO only\n",
    "- 48:00 - applies to AI systems um if you answer yes to developer here then what happens\n",
    "- 48:07 - is is in the requirements section we're only going to pull in the requirements\n",
    "- 48:11 - that are applicable to developers sorry Raman just asked me to\n",
    "- 48:16 - link this to them um\n",
    "- 48:23 - and so really it's just filtering of what questions do we ask in the next\n",
    "- 48:27 - stage it works the same way you respond yes here um in this there's like a\n",
    "- 48:32 - there's a little comment that gives you instructions on what to do so on each of\n",
    "- 48:36 - these subtasks it says read the question um select your\n",
    "- 48:42 - response mark it complete when you're done you can do a bunch of these in\n",
    "- 48:53 - sequence again each time it's you click complete if it's successful we get the\n",
    "- 48:58 - response received feedback uh when all five are done the category gets marked\n",
    "- 49:02 - complete it gets reassigned to here it should be AI at all true oh it's still\n",
    "- 49:07 - Sagalink i don't know what's going on now um strange\n",
    "- 49:14 - can I ask a question so if for the first question AI systems definition if it's\n",
    "- 49:19 - no then all the other questions are are irrelevant but does it automatically\n",
    "- 49:24 - update for the other questions that you don't have to fill fill them out anymore\n",
    "- 49:29 - currently no um but again when we when we pull this whole risk assessment into\n",
    "- 49:34 - the front end then that'll be picked up right like okay that'll be like a kill\n",
    "- 49:40 - switch on the entire audit you answered no to that one then nothing else will be\n",
    "- 49:44 - presented to you you're done okay great thanks\n",
    "- 49:51 - yeah so underneath there where it says pending risk assessment under evidence\n",
    "- 49:56 - collection that's I think that's supported\n",
    "- 49:59 - by like I'm just trying to draw the link between what you're doing here because\n",
    "- 50:04 - this is the overall ISO 420001 and how it relates to the stuff\n",
    "- 50:11 - that we're doing in the knowledge hub like the AI policy like is that stuff\n",
    "- 50:16 - feels like it's all in support of this general it is exactly but you'll you'll\n",
    "- 50:20 - see it right now um so we completed this section we got our risk assessment\n",
    "- 50:24 - outcome which is a risk category of general these are your obligations for\n",
    "- 50:30 - general risk level and now give it a second for this\n",
    "- 50:37 - part to generate really don't understand what\n",
    "- 50:43 - happened here no errors still\n",
    "- 50:56 - am I correct that this is um so what the AI is doing in the back end is that it's\n",
    "- 51:02 - storing chunks of the uploaded document into vectors and then it's answering the\n",
    "- 51:07 - questions like that ex yep okay it's uh I mean if you want to read about it it's\n",
    "- 51:12 - just a a classic rag approach retrieval augmented generation\n",
    "- 51:20 - one thought came to mind like when it comes to doing demos and trying to make\n",
    "- 51:23 - this process faster is just to like have uh just upload one demo document and\n",
    "- 51:29 - then you know the answers already and then in the back end there's a special\n",
    "- 51:34 - function that deals just with that particular document and then it was seen\n",
    "- 51:38 - very very fast um during demos i I'll actually show you that right now because\n",
    "- 51:44 - that's exactly what we did uh okay awesome\n",
    "- 51:48 - yeah like we before a big demo Ron always has me set up an audit project to\n",
    "- 51:54 - exactly that point and then he just takes an AI policy uploads it on the AI\n",
    "- 51:58 - policy task and then the AI policy requirements are fulfilled\n",
    "- 52:03 - and it's perfect and it's fast and everything goes well exactly it's it's\n",
    "- 52:07 - smooth but the challenge is is like you guys can\n",
    "- 52:12 - see already how big these projects are like compliance is it's a monster right\n",
    "- 52:19 - and so it's tough to fit into a an hourong demo\n",
    "- 52:24 - yeah and on on average how many pages are these documents\n",
    "- 52:29 - uh the policy documents or I mean they go\n",
    "- 52:34 - anywhere from three pages to like a 100 pages in what we've seen from customers\n",
    "- 54:12 - okay our ISO is in progress all right that's actually going to take\n",
    "- 55:35 - a little bit of time to do um what am I going to do in the meantime\n",
    "- 56:39 - i apologize we're a little stuck here just going to have to wait for this to\n",
    "- 56:43 - run all right in the meantime I\n",
    "- 57:33 - will show you guys the content type rule quickly i'm going to do it on staging\n",
    "- 57:49 - here or do you guys want to go over your\n",
    "- 57:58 - questions that you had while we wait for this to run\n",
    "- 58:06 - i guess we can go over a couple of the questions\n",
    "- 58:14 - so if if you um if you navigate over to the\n",
    "- 58:22 - system one of the questions we had I think was in so so really it's it's a\n",
    "- 58:29 - couple questions like if you go into the AI\n",
    "- 58:33 - usage and you go into um I think it's it's issues\n",
    "- 58:43 - So what what actually gets populated here and the reason I ask that is\n",
    "- 58:48 - because like so far we've been working primarily with um like rerouting our LLM\n",
    "- 58:56 - requests through the through the through the AI gateway\n",
    "- 59:00 - through the proxy and and it you know like we have this uh slider which like\n",
    "- 59:08 - is either sanctioned or not sanctioned and when like we hit the\n",
    "- 59:13 - slider and unsanction something obviously it gets blocked blocked by the\n",
    "- 59:17 - proxy but it doesn't actually pop up here and so I'm wondering like what what\n",
    "- 59:23 - exactly is supposed to be going in there so that that is supposed to be going in\n",
    "- 59:28 - there um that was a a bug it's starting to appear now so I just tested this\n",
    "- 59:33 - before they still need to clean up something\n",
    "- 59:35 - here but you can see now that this this issue was created for usage by Oh I\n",
    "- 59:42 - guess someone marked it approved strange it's not appearing\n",
    "- 59:49 - there june's working on this right now um but the the issues are starting to be\n",
    "- 59:54 - created you're absolutely correct if in AI usage\n",
    "- 59:59 - policies an endpoint is marked unsanctioned and a request goes to it\n",
    "- 1:00:03 - it's supposed to generate an issue here okay okay there's there's another one\n",
    "- 1:00:07 - and this is Moran your turn to shine all right so the other thing that we do is\n",
    "- 1:00:14 - the network logs ZTNA logs right that's what we're thinking too like Exactly and\n",
    "- 1:00:20 - so we should be able to do that right now right [ __ ] there's no reason why we\n",
    "- 1:00:24 - can't can you repeat i couldn't hear you yeah\n",
    "- 1:00:28 - so we're going to configure Cloudflare to this demo environment right now\n",
    "- 1:00:34 - all right so what what I'll do is I'm going to generate\n",
    "- 1:00:38 - the the listener the API key and then we'll pass the screen over to you and\n",
    "- 1:00:43 - you can uh you can make the connection in\n",
    "- 1:00:46 - Cloudflare and show everybody how to do that sound good\n",
    "- 1:00:56 - yeah sure no problem all right okay so just heads up my computer is dying so I\n",
    "- 1:01:04 - it could crash in the middle of it so heads up all right okay we'll try all\n",
    "- 1:01:09 - right so in the admin console the user would come go to API\n",
    "- 1:01:14 - keys and then they would add a data dog listener API key so I'm going to call it\n",
    "- 1:01:20 - Cloudflare log push API key data dog\n",
    "- 1:01:29 - listener all right that's good uh they would click\n",
    "- 1:01:34 - submit all right so that adds a new API key here they take this API\n",
    "- 1:01:41 - key and what they do is they go into Cloudflare which [ __ ] will share his\n",
    "- 1:01:46 - screen now i'm gonna add this to the chat\n",
    "- 1:01:57 - [ __ ] you want to take over yeah one second let me grab the API key\n",
    "- 1:02:09 - so what what they're doing is they're taking their VTNA and they're they're\n",
    "- 1:02:14 - sending us the logs for it it's actually different depending on the platform\n",
    "- 1:02:18 - cloudflare is pushing um Net Scope which Moron's just about finished is pulling\n",
    "- 1:02:23 - logs instead so the integration's a little bit different but you can see\n",
    "- 1:02:28 - what Moron's doing here so we're mimicking\n",
    "- 1:02:35 - what sorry i was just asking we're we're mimicking basically like a data dog\n",
    "- 1:02:40 - listener so that this this so Cloudflare sends us the events in whatever data dog\n",
    "- 1:02:46 - format uh Ryan do you have the endpoint uh for the for the demo environment\n",
    "- 1:02:54 - good question i'm not actually sure if it's uh\n",
    "- 1:03:00 - demos or fraud i would assume it's\n",
    "- 1:03:06 - demos could I get the demoabi-ai security\n",
    "- 1:03:13 - yeah you could try it um Oops oh actually\n",
    "- 1:03:20 - api.demos.alltrbackend.com looks like it's the the right thing i'll send this\n",
    "- 1:03:24 - to you no this one here mr\n",
    "- 1:03:57 - show those fields are all optional right oh because you already have your uh you\n",
    "- 1:04:06 - already have it's configured to playground you're going to have to\n",
    "- 1:04:09 - delete one of those delete both of those\n",
    "- 1:04:26 - so from the cloud flare logs we can identify use of um like users accessing\n",
    "- 1:04:33 - LLM endpoints that haven't necessarily been\n",
    "- 1:04:37 - onboarded to our platform uh it's primarily AI services\n",
    "- 1:04:44 - ai services so you'll see like [ __ ] will go to chat GPT after this okay like\n",
    "- 1:04:50 - copilot I would imagine copilot we actually get through the Azure discovery\n",
    "- 1:04:56 - yeah exactly through purview so once once you like if you're using co-pilot\n",
    "- 1:05:01 - once you configure that Azure account we are we start to access it\n",
    "- 1:05:08 - through there okay so chat GPT\n",
    "- 1:05:15 - uh let me see what else is in the list here grammarly uh\n",
    "- 1:05:19 - there's a huge list it's a huge list it's like a couple hundred wow i can\n",
    "- 1:05:24 - pull from the code if you want to see the entire list\n",
    "- 1:05:29 - i can probably find it in GitHub I would imagine\n",
    "- 1:05:37 - and then does it the stuff that gets discovered here automatically starts to\n",
    "- 1:05:42 - populate in AI technologies yep it all it goes into inventory it gets logged as\n",
    "- 1:05:48 - usage in your usage dashboard issues are created if it's unsanctioned wow and\n",
    "- 1:05:55 - currently it's not automatically just want to heads up just want to say\n",
    "- 1:05:58 - because I still need to do some adjustment\n",
    "- 1:06:02 - um but yeah Ryan do you want me to change now to to the test user in\n",
    "- 1:06:08 - Cloudflare uh yes please yeah so my internet might get disconnected\n",
    "- 1:06:29 - and besides Cloudflare what else is this going to be supported for i I would\n",
    "- 1:06:34 - imagine Net Scope yeah Net Scope is nearly done\n",
    "- 1:06:39 - um and that that's all we've been there was one other that we've been uh asked\n",
    "- 1:06:45 - for once i can't remember the name i have it written down somewhere zcaler\n",
    "- 1:06:49 - yeah but they they wouldn't give us a uh an integration environment\n",
    "- 1:06:55 - they wouldn't let us they wouldn't give us developer access so we haven't done\n",
    "- 1:06:59 - it yet can you Can you hear me guys yep yep\n",
    "- 1:07:07 - okay switch to my test user now\n",
    "- 1:07:26 - where i have no idea where we got this list\n",
    "- 1:07:50 - from um but what I'm sending in the chat is all of the different services that\n",
    "- 1:07:54 - are covered or that we pull out from the logs it's comprehensive to say the least\n",
    "- 1:08:12 - yeah but I don't know i mean there are some obvious ones that I would expect\n",
    "- 1:08:17 - here that aren't in there uh so we're going to have to spend some\n",
    "- 1:08:23 - time building it out basically what I'm doing is getting\n",
    "- 1:08:30 - some activities that the cloudflare client\n",
    "- 1:08:34 - supposed to pick up you should be able to see them\n",
    "- 1:08:47 - not sure if you see my screen guys yes yeah it looks like it's all being picked\n",
    "- 1:08:56 - up yeah now um I need Ryan I need Do you know where\n",
    "- 1:09:05 - the um in which um in which Amazon uh account\n",
    "- 1:09:13 - these uh logs are being saved because currently it was directed to um\n",
    "- 1:09:21 - playground Amazon the question is it'll be going to the demo Amazon account now\n",
    "- 1:09:28 - that we have a access no what why do you need access though just to see if the\n",
    "- 1:09:34 - logs are there if uh you would have to ask Arsha\n",
    "- 1:09:40 - i But like I don't think he'll give you access to it um he would just be able to\n",
    "- 1:09:45 - tell you if they're there cuz so currently I need to do some\n",
    "- 1:09:52 - adjustments cuz my final codes are not in in\n",
    "- 1:09:55 - uh in developer i had this conversation yesterday with Tomir um so basically\n",
    "- 1:10:02 - what I need to do is update the the\n",
    "- 1:10:08 - Amazon account ID and some others access token and so on in order to get to\n",
    "- 1:10:15 - retrieve the code the the logs so I can't actually show you now on\n",
    "- 1:10:22 - no I can show you only in playground that's that's okay you can you can stop\n",
    "- 1:10:26 - sharing then I'll just show on playground what we've got there and\n",
    "- 1:10:32 - All right um are you are you planning to fix that so that it's actually running\n",
    "- 1:10:36 - end to end like by tomorrow okay yeah because\n",
    "- 1:10:40 - we we got to get this into the the IBM demo guys\n",
    "- 1:10:47 - um but so this this is playground and it kind of shows what [ __ ] had\n",
    "- 1:10:54 - connected previously grammarly activities from yesterday\n",
    "- 1:10:59 - basically chatgpt Instaex\n",
    "- 1:11:03 - Bonito.ai um all of these are approved that's why you don't see any issues here\n",
    "- 1:11:09 - but if like if we go to policies AI services you'll see all these have been\n",
    "- 1:11:12 - added to inventory and they're all currently marked as sanctioned\n",
    "- 1:11:18 - okay that answers the question of what's supposed to show up in AI services\n",
    "- 1:11:23 - um and then so do they appear like are they\n",
    "- 1:11:28 - just as soon as we get the logs are they just like born within the AI inventory\n",
    "- 1:11:33 - exactly yep and I'm Okay so and I assume it the way that they're born depends on\n",
    "- 1:11:40 - the discovery policy whether they are born like reviewed or unreed at that\n",
    "- 1:11:44 - point it's just like anything else we discover correct and I mean I I think\n",
    "- 1:11:49 - the default is unreed um because there's there's no such thing\n",
    "- 1:11:56 - really as an an initial scan in this scenario\n",
    "- 1:12:00 - right so by default everything is kind of considered a recurring\n",
    "- 1:12:06 - scan and recurring scans are automatically set to\n",
    "- 1:12:13 - unreed okay um if you go to AI inventory and you go\n",
    "- 1:12:19 - to issues what what is supposed to go in\n",
    "- 1:12:24 - unprotected AI is that also related to the\n",
    "- 1:12:31 - um like LLM L like the services that are discovered through logs or is it more\n",
    "- 1:12:36 - than that so it's it's really supposed to be things that you haven't done in\n",
    "- 1:12:40 - the platform um so you're you're raising a bug right\n",
    "- 1:12:46 - now there should be at least some issues in here unless somebody went through and\n",
    "- 1:12:51 - took every LLM endpoint and applied firewall rules that's that's exactly\n",
    "- 1:12:55 - what I was wondering yeah so it's it is a bug because like we were talking about\n",
    "- 1:12:58 - this earlier today and it's like we like I on board a new LLM endpoint manually\n",
    "- 1:13:04 - right open there yeah it should appear there until what I configure\n",
    "- 1:13:10 - like guardrails pentest on it you've configured guardrails on it um that\n",
    "- 1:13:16 - that's what we cons I mean it varies by resource but that's what we consider to\n",
    "- 1:13:20 - be protecting it i see so there's different requirements depending on the\n",
    "- 1:13:24 - resource that Exactly yeah qualify for it being in here or not exactly all\n",
    "- 1:13:29 - right um another's like logging if you don't have logging turned on for an\n",
    "- 1:13:36 - endpoint then that would be considered unprotected or it's like a different\n",
    "- 1:13:41 - type of unprotected it's a low severity unprotected issue what are the missing\n",
    "- 1:13:45 - protection types there in the drop down uh model scan not performed LLM pent not\n",
    "- 1:13:51 - performed firewall not active no logging cloud resource no policies so I guess\n",
    "- 1:13:56 - that one would be if you haven't turned on any misconfiguration checks\n",
    "- 1:14:02 - and the no logging on LLM endpoints is that like a like at the policy level in\n",
    "- 1:14:06 - the gateway it's uh no it's actually in the observability module oh that's right\n",
    "- 1:14:13 - yeah and that was actually I was wondering about like\n",
    "- 1:14:17 - like suppose you had for your project that the LLM endpoint is\n",
    "- 1:14:22 - in firewall turned off firewall logging which should be gateway sorry we\n",
    "- 1:14:28 - we've got to update that um that would be an unprotected issue because you're\n",
    "- 1:14:33 - not actually logging anything going through the gateway\n",
    "- 1:14:37 - and I think that's on by default isn't it it is on by default yeah it's on by\n",
    "- 1:14:42 - default and so if it's on by default then is there like a\n",
    "- 1:14:47 - practical application to having the log action in the guardrails that\n",
    "- 1:14:52 - differentiates it from just the standard logging that happens here or is the\n",
    "- 1:14:57 - logging meant to like say like if you don't want to log everything but you\n",
    "- 1:15:00 - only want to log specific things that's when it would make sense to use the log\n",
    "- 1:15:04 - action in the guard rails so when when we say logging's on by\n",
    "- 1:15:10 - default all you're seeing is just the input output by default when you turn on\n",
    "- 1:15:16 - a rule with a log action then you'll see the input the output plus if that rule\n",
    "- 1:15:22 - was triggered that'll be logged i see okay that's the distinction so you're\n",
    "- 1:15:28 - basically tagging it with the rule that got triggered exactly for reporting\n",
    "- 1:15:33 - purposes you got it\n",
    "- 1:15:37 - i have more questions but we can we can save them\n",
    "- 1:15:49 - yeah sure um you mean for the for the\n",
    "- 1:16:20 - runbook uh yeah we can take that offline yeah so we don't take up more time\n",
    "- 1:16:24 - during the training itself yeah we'll talk about that separately for sure no\n",
    "- 1:16:28 - problem all right um okay let's see\n",
    "- 1:17:04 - all right so this still hasn't run and Raman's looking into it it sounds like\n",
    "- 1:17:09 - the environment since we just created this demo environment doesn't have\n",
    "- 1:17:13 - access to a specific bedrock embedding model that's\n",
    "- 1:17:18 - required um which is a little bit odd because it worked here i see that this\n",
    "- 1:17:23 - was pre-populated uh so I've gota I got to\n",
    "- 1:17:27 - have him follow up on that but we're going to we're going to keep going\n",
    "- 1:17:35 - um so what I'm going to do is I'm going to generate this policy after the\n",
    "- 1:17:41 - meeting and I'll send you guys a link to it afterwards but the way that it\n",
    "- 1:17:44 - effectively works is you would fill in each of these\n",
    "- 1:17:47 - questions and then we take all of your answers and then we customize your\n",
    "- 1:17:53 - template based on your answers and spit out an AI\n",
    "- 1:17:57 - policy uh so for example like this this\n",
    "- 1:18:02 - response that I made here you would see something along these lines in the\n",
    "- 1:18:08 - policy template that gets generated now I I wish I could show it\n",
    "- 1:18:13 - to you uh it's pretty cool like it's cool to see the the policy that gets\n",
    "- 1:18:18 - created and actually have it reference what you wrote in here and it it looks\n",
    "- 1:18:21 - nothing like this it's like a beautiful AI policy um but yeah it'll just take\n",
    "- 1:18:29 - too long if we try to do that now so we're going to continue here so uh if\n",
    "- 1:18:34 - you guys recall we uploaded to the knowledge hub and AI management system\n",
    "- 1:18:40 - right at the beginning that's classified here as approved so when the ISO audit\n",
    "- 1:18:46 - went from the risk assessment to the requirements\n",
    "- 1:18:50 - section all of our requirements were generated the things that we need to\n",
    "- 1:18:54 - satisfy in order to achieve ISO compliance and that AI management system\n",
    "- 1:18:59 - policy that we uploaded got pulled in see we pulled in\n",
    "- 1:19:04 - altra Aai evidence review policy ISO AI management system exists in knowledge\n",
    "- 1:19:09 - base typo there and then if I start to look at\n",
    "- 1:19:14 - some of these requirements you'll see that we've prepopulated answers for the\n",
    "- 1:19:18 - customer requirement expected satisfied acme has established implemented and\n",
    "- 1:19:22 - documented an AI management system this answer is pulled directly from the\n",
    "- 1:19:28 - document that was uploaded uh let me see so this one says\n",
    "- 1:19:34 - additional evidence is required um this one requirement\n",
    "- 1:19:39 - expected satisfied i'm just trying to look for one that pulled in a screenshot\n",
    "- 1:19:42 - because it's supposed to all right so what's what's supposed\n",
    "- 1:20:02 - to happen here is you're supposed to actually get a screenshot of the\n",
    "- 1:20:04 - document and it works in playground not sure why it's not working on the demo\n",
    "- 1:20:07 - environment um but it's another thing for Raman to look\n",
    "- 1:20:11 - into and so you can imagine that if a customer had all of these policies and\n",
    "- 1:20:16 - they uploaded them then all of the functionally most of the requirements\n",
    "- 1:20:21 - would start to be filled in like you can see just that one AI management system\n",
    "- 1:20:25 - has has prepopulated or has pulled in responses for all of the questions in\n",
    "- 1:20:31 - the first category and the second category uh if I go to the third\n",
    "- 1:20:37 - category AI policy nothing was populated which makes sense right we we had\n",
    "- 1:20:42 - started to draft up an AI policy but we didn't finish it so there's nothing in\n",
    "- 1:20:46 - knowledge hub but now Abdel you asked earlier what if you already have an AI\n",
    "- 1:20:51 - policy so you can either upload it in knowledge hub like we did with the AI\n",
    "- 1:20:54 - management system or you can come here you can choose your\n",
    "- 1:21:01 - policy i'm going to take the AI policy i'm going to upload\n",
    "- 1:21:12 - it going to give it a couple of seconds received and uploaded great\n",
    "- 1:21:21 - um and now we may run into the same problem\n",
    "- 1:21:26 - that we ran into here uh but hopeful that we won't given that these were\n",
    "- 1:21:36 - answered i actually see it in the knowledge hub 2 now under approved the\n",
    "- 1:21:42 - AI policy cool\n",
    "- 1:21:51 - here it is document name\n",
    "- 1:22:04 - though and just for the for the guys on the call looks like you can download the\n",
    "- 1:22:08 - documents right from the page itself so I'll I'll download those download those\n",
    "- 1:22:13 - and send them to you guys you can see the system's working\n",
    "- 1:22:29 - very hard um analyzing evidence attachments oh\n",
    "- 1:22:34 - it's actually it's working on the uh the policy builder one right now so we may\n",
    "- 1:22:39 - actually start yeah there you go you can start to see these things being\n",
    "- 1:22:43 - populated i don't know what I guess Raman must have updated the model for us\n",
    "- 1:22:48 - um but you can see I I took that one existing policy and uploaded it and\n",
    "- 1:22:56 - now it's it's filled in answers for most of these questions saying question fully\n",
    "- 1:23:02 - addressed this one question partially addressed so it's telling me this is\n",
    "- 1:23:05 - what I need to do still provide specific details on the methodologies tools or\n",
    "- 1:23:10 - frameworks it's actually very slick when it works\n",
    "- 1:23:16 - when it works again it like there's there should\n",
    "- 1:23:24 - be screenshots here and I want to show you guys what that looks like so\n",
    "- 1:23:30 - that can see let me try this guy no this is too old have it\n",
    "- 1:24:08 - Oh show you one on playground for sure oh maybe not let's try this\n",
    "- 1:24:20 - one oh so you can see on playground that update is already in\n",
    "- 1:24:25 - place where I I'm not the owner of this project the owner Sigal Link uh so I\n",
    "- 1:24:31 - shouldn't normally be able to access it but there was a little toast that\n",
    "- 1:24:34 - appeared saying checking a sauna access i didn't have it so it added me and now\n",
    "- 1:24:39 - I should be able to see it yeah there we go uh no nothing populated in this one\n",
    "- 1:24:47 - let's try another All\n",
    "- 1:25:17 - right there you can see screenshots so that's what it's supposed to look like\n",
    "- 1:25:22 - like the system goes pulls out evidence from\n",
    "- 1:25:26 - it and it gives you a reference it says acme policy.pdf page 10 and then spits\n",
    "- 1:25:33 - out a screenshot of the actual page that it came from and so like the\n",
    "- 1:25:38 - screenshots's not necessary but auditors love to see evidence they love to be\n",
    "- 1:25:43 - able to track track down where something came from and so that's why we include\n",
    "- 1:25:48 - that and you can see here like this question is does your organization\n",
    "- 1:25:54 - review the AI policy at planned intervals uh Altru suggests at least\n",
    "- 1:25:58 - annual reviews the response says \"ACME reviews its AI policy at least once a\n",
    "- 1:26:03 - year and additionally after major AI failures or regulatory\n",
    "- 1:26:06 - changes.\" Uh then a bunch of nice filler this review process is part of\n",
    "- 1:26:12 - Acme's commitment to maintaining transparency blah blah blah and then\n",
    "- 1:26:17 - from the actual document you can see the review of policy acme reviews this AI\n",
    "- 1:26:21 - policy at least once a year and additionally after major AI failures or\n",
    "- 1:26:23 - regulatory changes so it it like pulled exactly what it needed to out of the\n",
    "- 1:26:28 - document and wrapped it up a nice answer and so at this point it's still up to\n",
    "- 1:26:35 - the user to mark the task complete exactly we we uh debated whether or not\n",
    "- 1:26:42 - we should mark it complete ourselves and decided that it's probably safer to have\n",
    "- 1:26:47 - the user review it first it's our way of having a human in the loop it's the only\n",
    "- 1:26:51 - way we would pass the EUAI act audit so yeah\n",
    "- 1:26:57 - all right good question so if it does work how long would it usually take\n",
    "- 1:27:03 - um it's a good question uh when we do it live in demos on prod like upload an AI\n",
    "- 1:27:12 - policy and see it pulled in it usually takes five minutes to answer all 11 of\n",
    "- 1:27:17 - these questions okay got it thanks\n",
    "- 1:27:26 - Now what's going on it's like it's uh Oh here that's got\n",
    "- 1:27:36 - to be the problem all\n",
    "- 1:28:03 - right okay so this file that I uploaded here got\n",
    "- 1:28:08 - pulled into knowledge hub it's supposed to populate these but it's hung up for\n",
    "- 1:28:13 - some reason um which I've just passed on to Raman i'm sure he'll unstick it but\n",
    "- 1:28:19 - you can see there were a ton of errors for the last couple of minutes here so\n",
    "- 1:28:23 - something has been breaking which upload was that for which that was the AI\n",
    "- 1:28:30 - policy that I uploaded oh I uploaded it to the evidence collection\n",
    "- 1:28:36 - section so like these are the documents that you upload and then it's mapped to\n",
    "- 1:28:42 - then say or to then try to satisfy these 11 questions in the AI policy section i\n",
    "- 1:28:49 - thought that was the one that he had unstuck maybe I So what he unstuck was\n",
    "- 1:28:54 - in the policy template builder this guy okay right so I took the existing one i\n",
    "- 1:29:01 - uploaded it here and then now I can actually we'll go through it we'll just\n",
    "- 1:29:04 - answer all these questions um I'm going to add something additional\n",
    "- 1:29:11 - here acme is committed to complying with voluntary artificial intelligence\n",
    "- 1:29:15 - standards uh we are also required to satisfy the\n",
    "- 1:29:23 - purple elephant convention of 2023 just something ridiculous that hopefully\n",
    "- 1:29:31 - gets pulled in so it works the same way as\n",
    "- 1:29:37 - everything else where you mark it complete when your answer is\n",
    "- 1:29:43 - done should pick up the category the only thing I'll note is\n",
    "- 1:29:50 - that if you go too quickly occasionally it gets stuck and then it it picks it up\n",
    "- 1:29:56 - after 30 minutes it goes it unstep like it goes and undoes the action and then\n",
    "- 1:30:03 - the web hook re-triggers um but it's worth like just when you're playing with\n",
    "- 1:30:08 - an audit just click everything really quickly and see what happens so that you\n",
    "- 1:30:14 - know how to unstick it in demos I'm always very careful to\n",
    "- 1:30:20 - go slowly like if you do too many things at the same time the web hooks conflict\n",
    "- 1:30:25 - and then it breaks so I always go pretty like deliberately as opposed to\n",
    "- 1:30:33 - just going click click click click does it make sense to just wait\n",
    "- 1:30:49 - till it goes green before clicking on you can\n",
    "- 1:30:55 - um I'm feeling risky right now so but yeah it's if you wait until the\n",
    "- 1:31:04 - category goes green you're definitely safe so one one of the things that's a\n",
    "- 1:31:11 - little still confusing to me like this this AI policy is in support of the ISO\n",
    "- 1:31:19 - um 420,01 right\n",
    "- 1:31:22 - yep so what you're doing here does that get fed back into that main ISO 420001\n",
    "- 1:31:29 - workflow yes um I mean what we're going to see\n",
    "- 1:31:35 - satisfying certain requirements here yeah so all of these because I already\n",
    "- 1:31:39 - uploaded a policy that I know is good are going to be satisfied like these 11\n",
    "- 1:31:44 - when the system gets unstuck that's already going to be done but if I hadn't\n",
    "- 1:31:48 - done that if I hadn't uploaded that here right this would finish so you'll see\n",
    "- 1:31:54 - now the policy you would have uploaded it here it would have answered whatever\n",
    "- 1:31:58 - it could from there and then you finish this process here and then what happens\n",
    "- 1:32:02 - in the main So you'll see so the policy template project just went from in\n",
    "- 1:32:06 - progress to completed congratulations you finished\n",
    "- 1:32:10 - access the generated file in the knowledge hub now if I go to knowledge\n",
    "- 1:32:13 - hub if I go back to draft my AI policy draft is no longer\n",
    "- 1:32:18 - there if I go to under review now I have an AI policy document okay if I download\n",
    "- 1:32:24 - that you're going to see Oh we'll actually see if this is the\n",
    "- 1:32:29 - new IBM skin i don't know if it is you get a word document\n",
    "- 1:32:45 - look like this my Acme AI policy um based again based on the answers that\n",
    "- 1:32:52 - you provide it populates all of this so we we populated it with an existing\n",
    "- 1:32:58 - policy so it pulled in answers from the existing policy and then filled this in\n",
    "- 1:33:03 - um and like for example AI objectives is\n",
    "- 1:33:08 - blank for some reason don't know why i got to look into\n",
    "- 1:33:12 - that but all of this information was pulled in purple elephant convention of\n",
    "- 1:33:16 - 2023 in our applicable regulations um and so the kind of the flow is the\n",
    "- 1:33:26 - user gets this they update it and then what I kind of imagine happening is they\n",
    "- 1:33:32 - save it as a PDF and then they would re-upload the\n",
    "- 1:33:36 - PDF version we don't have that right now um like the way that it should happen is\n",
    "- 1:33:40 - they click approve document and or there's like a version upload new\n",
    "- 1:33:44 - version or something okay and then when that\n",
    "- 1:33:49 - happens like if I click approve here now it moves from under review to\n",
    "- 1:33:54 - approved and then immediately gets pulled into your audits i understand so\n",
    "- 1:33:59 - so basically you just kind of cheated because we were having issues and you\n",
    "- 1:34:03 - already had a PDF exactly was pre-generated with this process that you\n",
    "- 1:34:07 - used for that main audit but typically you would start with this AI policy\n",
    "- 1:34:12 - template you would go through this whole rigomear roll and then it would go into\n",
    "- 1:34:17 - under review when you were done and you would approve it and then it generates a\n",
    "- 1:34:22 - document that you can actually use to in the main audit the main 420001 audit\n",
    "- 1:34:27 - exactly you got it so now it's in my approved in knowledge hub and then if if\n",
    "- 1:34:33 - I hadn't already uploaded something here when the audit kicks off or as soon as\n",
    "- 1:34:37 - it was created it would get pulled into this task yeah you wouldn't have to\n",
    "- 1:34:41 - actually push it in there it would pick it up automatically exactly picks it up\n",
    "- 1:34:45 - automatically satisfied the same way that these questions were satisfied by\n",
    "- 1:34:49 - the AI management system these guys would also be satisfied yep\n",
    "- 1:34:54 - yeah I'm understanding now thank you now the the last thing that actually there's\n",
    "- 1:35:00 - two more things in a compliance audit that a user can do one is a video\n",
    "- 1:35:06 - evidence collection meeting and this you're going to have to\n",
    "- 1:35:10 - do on your own because I can't have two Zooms open but effectively what you do\n",
    "- 1:35:14 - is you just come here you say start a meeting you click\n",
    "- 1:35:25 - comment and then the bot responds it gives you instructions on what to do and\n",
    "- 1:35:30 - here it says join Zoom meeting and this is a Zoom meeting that we've just\n",
    "- 1:35:33 - created and you're going to be the only like whoever generated this is the only\n",
    "- 1:35:38 - person that's going to be in it it's automatically recorded and so I actually\n",
    "- 1:35:43 - have an example of one from the other\n",
    "- 1:35:52 - day no yeah we made this ourselves it's like\n",
    "- 1:35:58 - it's our Zoom account um when they click this link our Zoom account initiates the\n",
    "- 1:36:02 - meeting records the meeting uh I mean play around with it yourself\n",
    "- 1:36:08 - it's it's cool to see the only annoying thing right now is that you have to type\n",
    "- 1:36:12 - in the chat the requirement question before you start to answer something um\n",
    "- 1:36:17 - but I'll send each of you guys a video of one that I\n",
    "- 1:36:21 - created that I already did it's like a short two-minute video i cover like\n",
    "- 1:36:25 - three requirements and then let me just find\n",
    "- 1:36:30 - where it came out i think it was here so is this the thing where the user just\n",
    "- 1:36:38 - kind of clicks around yeah on their screen exactly and then\n",
    "- 1:36:44 - the system knows what to screenshot and use it for evidence exactly so you'll\n",
    "- 1:36:48 - see here so again the annoying thing is that you need to tell the system what\n",
    "- 1:36:54 - question you're talking about in the chat we we aren't smart enough to pick\n",
    "- 1:36:57 - it up automatically um but so like this was one that I did last week and so in\n",
    "- 1:37:03 - the chat transcript at 44 seconds I typed in 1.1 staff AI literacy level\n",
    "- 1:37:08 - then I did 1.2 so these are the four questions that I covered at the end of\n",
    "- 1:37:12 - the meeting you get this evidence processed meeting summary um and\n",
    "- 1:37:19 - then in here you can see uh so like this was an automated\n",
    "- 1:37:26 - evidence response requirement expected expected satisfied this was populated\n",
    "- 1:37:30 - just based on what I said in the meeting just whatever I said verbally was pulled\n",
    "- 1:37:34 - in here this guy was satisfied based on screenshots\n",
    "- 1:37:39 - so this like the Zoom meeting was recorded obviously I was sharing my\n",
    "- 1:37:43 - screen and so then based on what I said and then frames from the meeting it\n",
    "- 1:37:50 - generated an answer that was good enough to satisfy the requirement and again\n",
    "- 1:37:55 - like all of this evidence would then be pulled into the audit report at the in\n",
    "- 1:38:00 - the appendix where we document the answers the screenshots also get pulled\n",
    "- 1:38:04 - in um just as like a a for record\n",
    "- 1:38:11 - Okay there's another there was something else that\n",
    "- 1:38:29 - Ron was showing from this meeting but I can't remember what it was\n",
    "- 1:38:34 - uh have to find it later but yeah that that's what the in the video evidence\n",
    "- 1:38:39 - collection does so try it yourself um again you go to initiate an evidence\n",
    "- 1:38:44 - collection meeting you type start meeting you comment it it the system\n",
    "- 1:38:47 - responds with the start a meeting link you click start a meeting Zoom will open\n",
    "- 1:38:52 - show whatever you want again copy the question name into the Zoom chat before\n",
    "- 1:38:58 - you start talking about it um when you're done just leave the meeting you\n",
    "- 1:39:02 - don't have to do anything else the system will pull the recording off of\n",
    "- 1:39:05 - Zoom go through it analyze each of the\n",
    "- 1:39:08 - questions that you you said in the chat and then populate the responses\n",
    "- 1:39:15 - here uh and then the last\n",
    "- 1:39:20 - thing that customers can do is just manual responses right you\n",
    "- 1:39:25 - can you can go to a question uh let me say AI policy appropriateness is the AI\n",
    "- 1:39:32 - policy compatible with your organization strategic direction\n",
    "- 1:39:36 - uh yes it is compatible and so some of these are just\n",
    "- 1:39:44 - like yes or no have you done it other ones require you to fill in\n",
    "- 1:39:49 - details uh again it's like a checklist you can imagine it like an Excel\n",
    "- 1:39:54 - spreadsheet the difference is is that you fill in a response and you get\n",
    "- 1:39:57 - immediate feedback as to whether or not you've satisfied\n",
    "- 1:40:00 - it uh so again I commented it i clicked yes and then follow up required request\n",
    "- 1:40:07 - additional information we cannot yet determine whether you satisfy the\n",
    "- 1:40:10 - question based on the details and information provided uh but it does not\n",
    "- 1:40:13 - address whether the policy is appropriate for the organization's\n",
    "- 1:40:17 - purpose um so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my AI\n",
    "- 1:40:22 - policy and I'm going to upload it instead try\n",
    "- 1:40:26 - again um see attached our full policy uh it is appropriate for the\n",
    "- 1:40:37 - organization's purpose we'll see if this gets stuck as\n",
    "- 1:41:02 - well for the same reason as this guy got stuck\n",
    "- 1:41:10 - hi Ryan so this step is the AI reading through the PDF and answering the\n",
    "- 1:41:14 - question or it's just uh Okay yeah it's it's going through the full PDF if you\n",
    "- 1:41:20 - upload it this way and and by the end of it will you get\n",
    "- 1:41:26 - like a documents that says you have completed all of the items on the\n",
    "- 1:41:30 - checklist and now you're ISO compliant yep exactly you'll get something like uh\n",
    "- 1:41:36 - what I showed you before what was that like this audit report this one was for\n",
    "- 1:41:41 - EUAI act um but you'll get one for ISO that\n",
    "- 1:41:46 - follows the same structure cover letter what was looked at your responses your\n",
    "- 1:41:51 - risk assessment uh outcome etc okay great\n",
    "- 1:42:09 - thanks all right i don't know if this is just because the files large and so it's\n",
    "- 1:42:14 - it takes time or if there's something that's stuck here um\n",
    "- 1:42:19 - but the way things have been going today I'm leaning towards the ladder\n",
    "- 1:42:47 - says it was successfully completed task failed\n",
    "- 1:42:59 - successfully yeah exactly anyways it didn't reopen it so I I\n",
    "- 1:43:08 - assume the system accepted the response and just forgot to respond\n",
    "- 1:43:12 - satisfied um I'm going to try one more here oh\n",
    "- 1:43:18 - close up shot of this\n",
    "- 1:45:37 - See so it tells you like based on the evidence that you provided what is still\n",
    "- 1:45:42 - outstanding what do you still need to add to your response or what what do you\n",
    "- 1:45:45 - need to confirm in order to be satisfied um yeah and then for example with these\n",
    "- 1:45:58 - ones where it was expected satisfied if I just click complete it should be\n",
    "- 1:46:03 - accepted as satisfied now where did you see that this oh sorry go\n",
    "- 1:46:16 - ahead oh sorry yeah So whenever the AI makes\n",
    "- 1:46:20 - an update by you know um creating a comment does the user get a notification\n",
    "- 1:46:26 - by email or on on on the ASA platform how does the user get notified that\n",
    "- 1:46:32 - something has updated um it's a good question right now we\n",
    "- 1:46:40 - don't have repeat notifications um I think what we probably should do is\n",
    "- 1:46:47 - like tag them or something tag the user to say it got reopened i mean the way\n",
    "- 1:46:51 - that they can tell that it it wasn't satisfied is the requirement is still\n",
    "- 1:46:55 - open now right they marked it complete and when we said request additional\n",
    "- 1:47:00 - information we reopened the comment or the the\n",
    "- 1:47:04 - subtask so they can just come to this page and they can see which ones are\n",
    "- 1:47:08 - still open in order to know where they need to take action\n",
    "- 1:47:12 - okay gotcha thank you yeah now if I go back to my audit in the\n",
    "- 1:47:19 - dashboard I should see Yeah see I'm at 163 of 164\n",
    "- 1:47:27 - requirements so still a ways to go on this one uh but if I were\n",
    "- 1:47:33 - to go through and mark all the ones that were expected\n",
    "- 1:47:54 - satisfied now all these are getting picked\n",
    "- 1:48:03 - up i come back here and refresh now my progress is up to\n",
    "- 1:48:08 - 3% 158 left it's it's not an easy process um\n",
    "- 1:48:19 - but compliance audits are not an easy process in general like it's it's really\n",
    "- 1:48:23 - not magic and we're trying to get more and more things that are streamlined but\n",
    "- 1:48:29 - it's still it's still tough um do you guys feel like you have enough\n",
    "- 1:48:38 - to go off and play with it like do you feel like you know what the basic\n",
    "- 1:48:42 - functionality is and how do I submit an answer and what am I expecting to\n",
    "- 1:48:48 - see are there any areas that you want to cover in more detail\n",
    "- 1:48:53 - i think we have enough to start going through the video probably one more time\n",
    "- 1:48:58 - and and clicking around and um like because that's been I I guess that's\n",
    "- 1:49:03 - been my sort of flow like I go through the videos and I start exploring and\n",
    "- 1:49:06 - clicking around and then I end up having a bunch of questions that I can follow\n",
    "- 1:49:10 - up with later that seems to be working okay yeah um sorry there's one other\n",
    "- 1:49:16 - thing that I forgot to show here uh let me do ah no my the one that I always do\n",
    "- 1:49:22 - is already satisfied uh let me pick something else here\n",
    "- 1:49:41 - so if you were to make a comment that's blatantly\n",
    "- 1:49:46 - wrong right like before on on this guy here I submitted something and the\n",
    "- 1:49:52 - system said \"We don't have enough yet to say\n",
    "- 1:49:56 - whether or not you satisfy it you need to add some more context.\" So you got\n",
    "- 1:50:01 - follow-up required request additional information if you say something that's\n",
    "- 1:50:05 - just blatantly wrong we don't care about other people we don't do impact\n",
    "- 1:50:09 - assessments you get a different thing you get follow-up required suggested\n",
    "- 1:50:13 - remediation and it says what the what the remediation is like engage relevant\n",
    "- 1:50:17 - stakeholders to capture diverse perspectives confirm that this\n",
    "- 1:50:21 - remediation has been implemented or upload documentation if you prefer\n",
    "- 1:50:25 - um if I go back to the platform now you'll\n",
    "- 1:50:28 - see one outstanding remediation issue has been created I click over here oh\n",
    "- 1:50:35 - actually we have two um but you've got your identification of impacts\n",
    "- 1:50:42 - And then you get the the remediation that we just saw over there you get an\n",
    "- 1:50:48 - issue created and then this this is something that\n",
    "- 1:50:52 - uh that then hits your risk score right it's it's not just hey we don't we don't\n",
    "- 1:50:58 - know enough about you like we need more information in your answer to make a\n",
    "- 1:51:01 - determination we're saying hey you you have a compliance gap like this is a\n",
    "- 1:51:05 - breach in your current compliance process or your current controls related\n",
    "- 1:51:09 - to ISO that needs to be fixed you have an issue um so that's that's the last\n",
    "- 1:51:15 - part to compliance that's worth highlighting the issues page\n",
    "- 1:51:20 - and then again if I were to then come back here\n",
    "- 1:51:23 - do we generate an issue every time that somebody fills in a task without\n",
    "- 1:51:27 - sufficient justification where or does it depend on the severity of the\n",
    "- 1:51:32 - requirement so again like we didn't generate an issue on this guy right\n",
    "- 1:51:36 - right we So it turns out that we did generate an issue on this so\n",
    "- 1:51:41 - apparently whatever I put in here wasn't enough there was a remediation and the\n",
    "- 1:51:46 - system just didn't post it but on this guy where my initial response didn't\n",
    "- 1:51:52 - trigger a remediation it just said request additional information no issue\n",
    "- 1:51:58 - was generated right so it's only if it's\n",
    "- 1:52:01 - blatantly bad if it's like clearly obvious that you're doing something\n",
    "- 1:52:04 - wrong then we generate an issue and that's like a some kind of a judgment\n",
    "- 1:52:10 - call that the system does internally yeah exactly on some bas Okay there's\n",
    "- 1:52:15 - some there's a criteria that we put in that we feed into it and based on that\n",
    "- 1:52:19 - it determines it i mean you can tell on this one that it was like very obviously\n",

    "- 1:53:44 - outstanding remediation uh any questions about issues\n",
    "- 1:53:55 - how often do users have to um undergo this process in order to be ISO\n",
    "- 1:54:01 - compliant once a year i mean ISO technically is just one time and then\n",
    "- 1:54:08 - actually it is once a year as well eu AI act is also once a year um\n",
    "- 1:54:16 - like Mcast for example is just kicking they they did their ISO compliance\n",
    "- 1:54:21 - uh I think they finished it in November and so they're they're already starting\n",
    "- 1:54:27 - their update for this year they have to like prepare all the updated documents\n",
    "- 1:54:32 - and then they have to go to their external auditor and go through that\n",
    "- 1:54:36 - whole song and dance okay\n",
    "- 1:54:41 - oh so this does the gap testing but they do have to go to like another auditor to\n",
    "- 1:54:45 - actually verify that they comply with everything um and also what are what is\n",
    "- 1:54:51 - the list of uh what is the entire list of frameworks that we offer GAP testing\n",
    "- 1:54:57 - for so EU AI act ISO 420,1 and NIST AIMF\n",
    "- 1:55:05 - they're in the audit page right the audit exactly yeah these these three\n",
    "- 1:55:10 - here and then we created this kind of bespoke uh accountability report for\n",
    "- 1:55:16 - GSK and okay we we figured we might as well keep that in the system like\n",
    "- 1:55:21 - there's no reason to we've added this framework that asks a bunch of good AI\n",
    "- 1:55:26 - related questions and so we just made that into something generic not GSK\n",
    "- 1:55:30 - related okay one this might be a silly question\n",
    "- 1:55:36 - but like for GSK wouldn't they have to comply with HIPPA or like not on our\n",
    "- 1:55:42 - scope they they do have to do GDPR they do have to do HIPPA but all of those\n",
    "- 1:55:46 - things they have existing processes for right\n",
    "- 1:55:49 - oh okay got it so we're we're focusing on AI related right now as soon like if\n",
    "- 1:55:56 - we were to bring GDPR into it it just becomes a a whole can of worms um Okay\n",
    "- 1:56:03 - all right makes sense we're we're only doing things where\n",
    "- 1:56:11 - eventually potentially right now it's not great but eventually the platform\n",
    "- 1:56:17 - will automatically fill it in and actually I should show you that if I go\n",
    "- 1:56:20 - to resources here and I go to as resource\n",
    "- 1:56:25 - requirements uh sorry AI system component\n",
    "- 1:56:30 - documentation remember the bomb that we looked at the other\n",
    "- 1:56:34 - day that's been automatically pulled in here so like\n",
    "- 1:56:38 - Mcast even though they did it last year their process for AI inventory to\n",
    "- 1:56:43 - satisfy this requirement AI system component documentation was a\n",
    "- 1:56:47 - spreadsheet they literally like went through their their code line by line\n",
    "- 1:56:52 - and spat out a spreadsheet which obviously is a nightmare to\n",
    "- 1:56:58 - produce and so this year what they're going to do is they've they're\n",
    "- 1:57:02 - configuring their AWS accounts they're configurating their code repos and\n",
    "- 1:57:06 - they're just going to take the bomb that we generate and that'll be their\n",

    "- 1:57:12 - than spending he said that they spent three weeks going through and figuring\n",
    "- 1:57:17 - out all of their AI inventory last time um yeah that's\n",
    "- 1:57:23 - so they were pretty excited about this step when we upload a like a bomb into\n",
    "- 1:57:29 - the system this way does it have to be in that cyclone DX in JSON or does it\n",
    "- 1:57:35 - does the system recognize other formats this was generated by the system\n",
    "- 1:57:40 - right yeah okay so as long as they're using our platform for\n",
    "- 1:57:46 - inventory then we populate it for them there's nothing that they\n",
    "- 1:57:51 - upload they could certainly upload something but we don't actually do\n",
    "- 1:57:56 - anything with the file right if they if they upload something and say \"This is\n",
    "- 1:57:59 - our AI bomb,\" then we just say \"Okay great that's your AI bomb.\" And we say\n",
    "- 1:58:03 - \"You're good.\" Yep um we don't do any validation again it's like it's\n",
    "- 1:58:08 - ultimately their responsibility to confirm that they're not lying about\n",
    "- 1:58:12 - something uh\n",
    "- 1:58:17 - yeah we're like a tax accountant we're only as good as the information you give\n",
    "- 1:58:23 - us and we take no liability otherwise and just out of curiosity who usually\n",
    "- 1:58:34 - you know who would have spent three weeks you know going through the code\n",
    "- 1:58:38 - line by line to generate these materials for auditing purposes is it like CISO or\n",
    "- 1:58:45 - or like who who is the person who who does this it's usually quarterbacked by\n",
    "- 1:58:51 - an auditor like they they all have their own internal auditors\n",
    "- 1:58:57 - um so okay it's like a compliance specialist\n",
    "- 1:59:02 - essentially and then they go out like their their process is usually to create\n",
    "- 1:59:07 - a bunch of spreadsheets with requirements and then send those to the\n",
    "- 1:59:09 - different teams and so what they can actually do\n",
    "- 1:59:13 - in our system is they can say \"All right um data resource documentation i don't\n",
    "- 1:59:19 - know how to do it i'm going to assign Ryan to go pick it up and then\n",
    "- 1:59:25 - Ryan will be added as a guest to this task has access to this task can respond\n",
    "- 1:59:31 - and then I can submit the response right like it allows them to\n",
    "- 1:59:35 - delegate out tasks all through a sauna that's that's part of what makes this\n",
    "- 1:59:39 - thing slick yeah that's nice that's actually a good point right because they\n",
    "- 1:59:44 - they whoever is managing this process may need like several individuals that\n",
    "- 1:59:50 - have nothing that have no knowledge of anything related to the platform itself\n",

    "- 2:00:04 - you know you you the system accommodates for like guest access we don't have to\n",
    "- 2:00:08 - actually go in there and build a user or create a user for everybody that needs\n",
    "- 2:00:12 - access to do um like like justifications in here essentially you're exactly right\n",
    "- 2:00:18 - yeah as long as it's somebody that already\n",

    "- 2:00:33 - fire out all these invitations to everybody\n",
    "- 2:00:37 - right and it's as simple as what I just did there like you all you have to do is\n",
    "- 2:00:41 - click that and then type in their email and that's it nice\n",
    "- 2:00:51 - yeah and that person will get a a notification i can show you what that\n",
    "- 2:00:56 - looks like that's what I just\n",
    "- 2:01:12 - got that's what it looks like all I have to do is click there to open\n",
    "- 2:01:21 - it um Asauna does let you do nice things like bulk assigning you could take all\n",
    "- 2:01:28 - three and assign them all to one person together you can bulk complete you can\n",
    "- 2:01:33 - like click all three and assign a response for the risk assessment\n",

    "- 2:02:10 - think you know to get into the get used to the flow it's something that we're\n",
    "- 2:02:14 - going to have to play around with for sure yeah yeah definitely\n",
    "- 2:02:21 - i think the biggest challenge that our users have is that a sauna is not\n",
    "- 2:02:27 - confined you know like if this was in our UI they wouldn't be able to do\n",
    "- 2:02:32 - anything else they would have like it would be very obvious to them where to\n",
    "- 2:02:35 - click what to do next it would be like a flow that we\n",
    "- 2:02:39 - maintain in a sauna it's not it's not really the case right like it's it's not\n",
    "- 2:02:45 - obvious when this page opens what do I do right and they have a bunch of\n",
    "- 2:02:48 - options that are probably irrelevant like calendar and messages and files and\n",
    "- 2:02:52 - timeline all this other stuff so we have this tutorial at the bottom\n",
    "- 2:02:58 - that's like meant to walk them through it um I don't know if anyone's ever\n",
    "- 2:03:03 - actually clicked on this and so we we probably need to like\n",
    "- 2:03:08 - create a little video in our system that when you kick off an audit you can like\n",
    "- 2:03:14 - watch it and it gives you the highle this is the 10 things you need to know\n",
    "- 2:03:18 - in order to complete your audit um but yeah that that's definitely been\n",
    "- 2:03:25 - the biggest sticking point so far it's like every customer that we've worked\n",
    "- 2:03:29 - with we've had to go and kind of walk them through what to\n",
    "- 2:03:33 - do and it's been slow like it it it takes three meetings\n",
    "- 2:03:40 - it takes the first meeting when the risk assessment is first created then it\n",
    "- 2:03:43 - takes another because they usually get stuck somewhere and then it takes\n",
    "- 2:03:47 - another when they get to requirements another question is so is it usually the\n",
    "- 2:03:57 - user who um does this or it's going to be somebody from Ochu who does maybe a\n",
    "- 2:04:04 - quarter to half of it when the user gets stuck or gets confused um or is it\n",
    "- 2:04:09 - supposed to be the case that the user does 100% of the checklist on it's\n",
    "- 2:04:14 - supposed to be the the user 100% i mean there's not really anything we can fill\n",
    "- 2:04:18 - in for them there's things that the system could automatically populate but\n",
    "- 2:04:23 - nothing manually done by us i think the when it comes to us it's more going to\n",
    "- 2:04:28 - be questions around like how do I do this um like you know customers not\n",
    "- 2:04:34 - understanding what to do next things like that in terms of the\n",
    "- 2:04:39 - actual questions for their own environment that's something that\n",
    "- 2:04:43 - they're going to have to go out and either know themselves or find out or\n",
    "- 2:04:48 - delegate to somebody in their organization\n",
    "- 2:04:52 - got it thanks okay uh I was hoping to cover TPRM today\n",
    "- 2:05:01 - but as you can see it's a very chunky uh module\n",
    "- 2:05:07 - so we're going to have to do TPRM tomorrow\n",

    "- 2:05:26 - uh yeah do you guys have any other questions right now or we good to go\n",
